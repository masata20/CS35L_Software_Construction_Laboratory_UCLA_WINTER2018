Laboratory: Linux and Emacs scavenger hunt

1. What shell command uses the man program to print the all the commands
  that have a specific word in their man page (or at least description
  part of the man page)?(hint: man man)
  
  	Ans:
  		>> man -k <a spefic word>

	Found from
	>> man man
	page, which states
	
	man -k printf
	Descrption:
		Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the 
		keyword printf as  regular  expression.  
		Print out any matches.  Equivalent to apropos -r printf.

==============================================================================
2. Where are the cp and wc programs located in the file system? 
   List any shell commands you used to answer this question.
	
	 I used the -k option learned from No.1
	 >> man -k path
	 then, I found
	 which (1)            - shows the full path of (shell) commands.
	 >> man which
	 it says:
	 	Description:
	 		Which takes one or more arguments. 
			For each of its arguments it prints to stdout the
			full path of the executables that would have been 
			executed when this argument had been entered 
			at the shell prompt.
	so I tried
	>> which cp wc
	/usr/local/cs/bin/cp
	/usr/local/cs/bin/wc

==============================================================================
3. What executable programs have names that are just one character long,
   and what do they do? List any shell commands you used to answer this 
   question.
	
	First, I need to find the way to find the executable programs
	so I look into find command
	>> man find
		, and I found
		-executable option which can search only for executable
		program

	>> find -executable
		, which showed all the executable program under the
		current directory
	
	Now, all the executable programs must be in the bin directory.
	There are several field we must check.
	To see all the field
	>> echo $PATH
	/usr/local/cs/bin:
	/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:
	/u/cs/ugrad/masataka/perl5/bin:
	/usr/lib64/ccache:
	/usr/local/bin:
	/usr/bin:
	/usr/X11R6/bin:
	/u/cs/ugrad/masataka/bin

	There are 7 different bin directory.
	We want to find the executable files under them
	To know how to operate find in specific directory
	>> man find
	and I can write the command like
	find [-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [path...] [expression]
	
	>> find /usr/local/cs/bin /usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin 
	   	/u/cs/ugrad/masataka/perl5/bin
	        /usr/local/bin /usr/bin /usr/X11R6/bin 
			/u/cs/ugrad/masataka/bin -executable
	, which shows all executable programs in specified directories.
	I found out there are no executables in the
	‘/usr/X11R6/bin'
	'/u/cs/ugrad/masataka/bin'
	'/u/cs/ugrad/masataka/perl5/bin'
	so we can exclude them next time.

	Since it showed too many, 
	I need to find the way to find only one char commands
	I can use the wildcard '?' which matches any single charcter.
	so in the end, to specify the pattern, we can use -name option
	(I read the man find page)
	>> find	/usr/local/cs/bin /usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin 
	        /usr/local/bin /usr/bin  -executable -name '?'
	,which shows
		/usr/local/cs/bin/[
		/usr/bin/X
		/usr/bin/w
		/usr/bin/[
		

	Now to find out what they do, I can use man command

	>> man [
	and it has statement:
		test and [ evaluate conditional 
		expressions using a set of rules based 
		on the number of arguments.
		and it is buildin bash commands
	
	>> man X
	and it showed:
		No manual entry for X
	
	NOTE:(Credit to TA Sneha Shankar)
		man X doesn't show up in some of the linex servers.
		We can use the whereis X commmand to find that out.
				>> whereis X
				X: /usr/bin/X
				in my lnxsrv09.
		If we use the lnxsrv03, 
		it shows another place to above, which is
				>> whereis X
				X: /usr/bin/X /usr/share/man/man7/X.7.gz
				in my lnxsrv03
		It explains why I couldn't find the man X page in lnxsrv09
	
	Under lnxsrv03
	>> man X
	and it states:
		a portable, network-transparent window system
	
	>> man w
	and it states:
		Show who is logged on and what they are doing.

==============================================================================
4. When you execute the command named by the symbolic link /usr/bin/emacs, 
   which file actually is executed? 
   List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

	Symbolic link means a file that connects to another file.
	To find the appropriate command to find the actual path
	>> man -k symbolic
	, and I found
		readlink (1) - 
			 print resolved symbolic links or canonical file names
	to know detail
	>> man readlink
	its format should be:
		readlink [OPTION]... FILE...
	so
	>> readlink /usr/bin/emacs
	, and it shows
		/etc/alternatives/emacs
	
	so /etc/alternatives/emacs is the actual file that will be executed.

==============================================================================
5. The chmod program changes permissions on a file.
   What does the symbolic mode g+s,o-x mean, in terms of permissions?
   
   To know detail,
   >> man chmod
   , which states:
   		change file mode bits
	it also explained what charcters stands for
		r - read
		w - write
		x - execute, or search for directory
		X -  execute/search only if the file is a directory 
			 or already has execute permission for some user
		s - set user or group ID on execution
		t - restricted deletion flag or sticky bit
		u - the user who owns the file 
		g - other users who are members of the file's group 
		o - users that are in neither of the two preceding categories
		a - all users
	The formant is:
		[ugoa...][[-+=][perms...]...]
			where:
			ugoa - controls which users' access to the
			        file will be change
			perms - either zero or more letters from the
			     set rwxXst, or a single letter from the set ugo
			+ operator - causes the selected file mode
			  	      bits to be added to 
			         the existing file mode bits of each file
			- operator - causes them to be removed
			= operator - causes them to be added and
			   causes unmentioned bits to be removed except 
                           that a directory's unmentioned set user 
			   and group ID bits are not affected.

	Therefore
	g+s - set groupID on execution
		  when users execute the file, 
		  it gives the file group's permission (setgid)
		  
		 
	o-x - remove the exection mode for others 
	      ("users that are in neigher of u and g category.)

==============================================================================
6. What option to find lets you search for files that have been modified 
   in the last three weeks?

	>> man find
	, and I found:
		-mtime n
			File's data was last modified n*24 hours ago.
			See the  comments  for  -atime  to  understand 
			how  rounding affects the interpretation of 
			file status change times.
		-atime n:
			File  was last accessed n*24 hours ago.  
			When find figures out how many 24-hour periods ago
			the file was last accessed, any fractional part 
			is ignored, so to match -atime +1, a file has to have
			 been  accessed  at least two days ago.
		==> we need to use 20 instead of 21 to know from 3 weeks ago

		Numeric arguments can be specified as
			 +n     for greater than n,
			 -n     for less than n,
			  n      for exactly n.
		==> so we need to use -20

		ex:
			find $HOME -mtime 0
			Search for files in your home directory
			which have been modified 
			in the last twenty-four hours.

	Therfore:
	>> find -mtime -20

==============================================================================
7. Use the previous answer to find all directories modified in 
   the last three weeks. 
   List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

   >> man find
   , and I found:
   		-type c
			File is of type c:
				b      block (buffered) special
				c      character (unbuffered) special
				d      directory
				p      named pipe (FIFO)
				f      regular file
				l      symbolic link; 
				       this is never true if the -L option or 
				       the -follow option is in effect,
				s      socket
				D      door (Solaris)
	
	Therefore:
	>> find -type d -mtime -20
	in home directory.

==============================================================================
8. Of the files in the same directory as find,
   how many of them are symbolic links? 
   List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

   To know the direcotry that has find,
   from No.2
   >> which find
   , gives:
   		usr/bin/find

   So we need to find the number of symbolic links in the usr/bin directory

   To find the symbolic links,
   from No.7
   >> find /usr/bin -type l
   , and it gives too many sybolic links to count.
   so we need to know the way to count the number of new line
   that will print by above command.
   we need to use wc command as we learned in the lecture.
   to count newline
   >> man wc
   , states:
   		-l, --lines
			 print the newline counts

	Therefore:
	>> find /usr/bin -type l | wc -l
	, which gives:
		293
	
	so 293 symbolic links
==============================================================================
9. What is the oldest regular file in the /usr/lib directory? 
   Use the last-modified time to determine age. Include files 
   (with names starting with ".") in your search. 
   List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

	>> man ls
	, and I found
		-l     use a long listing format
		-t     sort by modification time, newest first
		-r,    reverse order while sorting
	
	To see the all list, we use
	-l option, 
	but we want to sort by 
	modification time since problem asking us to use the 
	last-modified time to dertermine age, so we also use -t option.
	
	If we want to see the sort result with oldest first, we can also use
	-r option
		
	Therefore:(under lnxsrv07)
	>> cd /usr/lib
	>> ls -l -t -r
	, which shows the sorted list with oldest first
	and to determine whether it is file or not,
	we look at
	drwxr-xr-x
	if the first letter was '-', it is file.

	Therefore:
	-rwxr-xr-x   1 root root   18692 Jan 26  2014 libgpg-error.so.0.10.0
	is the oldest file in the /usr/lib directory

==============================================================================
10. Where does the locale command get its data from? 
	List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

	>> man locale
	, which states:
		When  invoked  without  arguments,  
		locale  displays  the  current  
		locale  settings  for  each locale category (see locale(5)), 
		based on the settings of the environment variables
		that control the locale (see locale(7)).
	
	>> man 5 locale
	, which states:
		 locale - describes a locale definition file
		 The  locale  definition file contains all the information
		 that the localedef(1) command needs to convert it into
		 the binary locale database.

	>> man 7 locale
	, which states:
		 A  locale  is a set of language and cultural rules. 
		 These cover aspects such as language for messages, 
		 different character sets, lexicographic conventions, 
		 and so on. 
		 A program needs to be able to determine its locale 
		 and act accordingly to be portable to different cultures.
		 The header <locale.h> declares data types,
		 functions and macros which are useful in this task.
	
	I need to know about localedef too, so
	>> man localedef
	, which states:
		localedef - compile locale definition files
		The  localedef  program  reads the indicated charmap and
	        input files, compiles them to a binary form quickly usable
	        by the locale functions in the C library (setlocale(3),
	        localeconv(3), etc.), and places the output in outputpath.
	, and also it states:
		* If outputpath contains a slash character ('/'),
		  it is interpreted as the name of the directory where
		  the output definitions are to be stored. In this case,
		  there is a separate output file for each locale category
		   (LC_TIME, LC_NUMERIC, and so on).
		* If the --no-archive option is used, 
		  outputpath is the name of a subdirectory 
		  in /usr/lib/locale where per-category compiled files
		  are placed.
		* Otherwise, outputpath is the name of a locale and the 
		  compiled locale data is added to the  archive  file 
		  /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive. 
		  A locale archive is a memory-mapped file 
		  which contains all the system provided locales; 
		  it is used by all localized programs when the
		  environment variable LOCPATH is not set.


	Therefore, locale date gets its command from whether
	- LC_TIME, LC_NUMERIC, etc
	- /usr/lib/locale
	- /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive
	depends on the condition of outputpath stated above.

==============================================================================
11. In Emacs, what commands have sort in their name? 
	List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.


	to invoke emacs
	>> emacs

	to get help
	>> C-h
	, which shows:
		a PATTERN  Show commands whose name matches the PATTERN
		  	    (a list of words or a regexp).
			     See also the ‘apropos’ command.
	so
	>> C-h a sort
	, which shows:
			Buffer-menu-sort              M-x ... RET
				Sort Tabulated List entries
				      by the column at point.

12. Briefly, what do the Emacs keystrokes C-M-a through C-M-h do? 
	Can you list their actions concisely? 
	List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

	>> emacs
	>> C-h
	, which showed:
		k KEYS     
		   Display the full documentation for the key sequence.
	>> C-x C-c

	so
	>> emacs
	>> C-h k C-M-a
	, which states:
		Move backward to the beginning of a defun.
	>> C-x o
	>> q

	>> C-h k C-M-b
	, which states:
		Move backward across one balanced expression (sexp).
	>> C-x o
	>> q

	>> C-h k C-M-c
	, which states:
		Exit from the innermost recursive edit or minibuffer.
	>> C-x o
	>> q

	>> C-h k C-M-d
	, which states:
		Move forward down one level of parentheses.
	>> C-x o
	>> q

	>> C-h k C-M-e
	, which states:
		Move forward to next end of defun.
	>> C-x o
	>> q

	>> C-h k C-M-f
	, which states:
		Move forward across one balanced expression (sexp).
	>> C-x o
	>> q

	>> C-h k C-M-g
	, which states:
		It is bound to C-g.
		Signal a ‘quit’ condition.
	>> C-x o
	>> q

	>> C-h k C-M-h
	, which states:
		Put mark at end of this defun, point at beginning.
	>> C-x o
	>> q

==============================================================================
13. In more detail, what does the Emacs keystroke C-g do? 
	List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

	>> emacs
	>> C-h k C-g
	, which states:
		C-g runs the command keyboard-quit (found in global-map), 
		which is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘simple.el’.
		Signal a ‘quit’ condition.
		During execution of Lisp code, 
		this character causes a quit directly.
		At top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.
	
	Simply, it can quit from whatever you are doing including during
	the exectuion of Lisp code.

==============================================================================
14. What does the Emacs yank function do? 
	List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

	>> emacs
	>> C-h
	, and I found:
		f FUNCTION  Display documentation for the given function.
	>> C-x C-c

	therefore,
	>> C-h f yank
	, which states:
		yank is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘simple.el’.
	In short, Reinsert ("paste") the last stretch of killed text.
		More precisely, reinsert the most recent kill, which is the
		stretch of killed text most recently killed OR yanked. 
	        Put point at the end, and set mark at the beginning 
		without activating it.
		With just C-u as argument, put point at beginning,
	        and mark at end.
		With argument N, reinsert the Nth most recent kill.
		It is bound to C-y.
	

==============================================================================
15. When looking at the directory /usr/bin, 
	what's the difference between the output of the ls -l command, 
	and the directory listing of the Emacs dired command? 
	List any shell or Emacs commands you used to answer this question

	>> cd /usr/bin
	>> ls -l
	It shows the long format of all files in that directory such as
		total 301660
		-rwxr-xr-x    1 root root       41496 Jun 30  2016 '['
		-rwxr-xr-x    1 root root      107856 Mar  2  2017  a2p
		-rwxr-xr-x    1 root root       52640 Oct  3 06:37  ab
		

	>> cd
	>> emacs
	>> C-h f dired
	, which states:
		It is bound to C-x d, <menu-bar> <file> <dired>.
	>> C-x o
	>> q
	>> C-x d
	>> /usr/bin (it had ~/ first, so I deleted and typed left path)
	It also shows the long format of all files in that directorys
	/usr/bin:
		total used in directory 301736 available 13401140
		dr-xr-xr-x.   2 root root       69632 Dec 28 13:15 .
		drwxr-xr-x.  15 root root        4096 Nov 18  2016 ..
		-rwxr-xr-x    1 root root       41496 Jun 30  2016 [
		-rwxr-xr-x    1 root root      107856 Mar  2  2017 a2p
		-rwxr-xr-x    1 root root       52640 Oct  3 06:37 ab


	Therefore, the difference between emacs dired command and ls -l is
	dired command showed
		dr-xr-xr-x.   2 root root       69632 Dec 28 13:15 .
		drwxr-xr-x.  15 root root        4096 Nov 18  2016 ..
	which is current directry and parent directly, respectively.
	while ls -l didn't show them.
	Also, emacs command showed
	total used in directory 301736 available 13401140 
	while ls -l showed
	total 301660.
